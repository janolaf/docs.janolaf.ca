It seems you have stumbled onto my little website. This is a place to document running my home network and possibly neovim config. Some of this may not be best practice

My home network runs a collection of Raspberry Pi OS, RHEL 8, Centos Streams 9
and Fedora.

At the moment there is a lot of placeholders.
